# I WELCOME THEE!

We're a friend duo who have big ideas and some skills to back it up. We learn eventually.

### DAPChat

DAPChat originally started as a small chat software in Node.JS until Replit discontinued hosting. The chat was riddled with bugs yet had impressive features that included a cross-server economy with skills, titles, backgrounds, and themes (to name a few). It featured a quest system that rewarded players for staying active and for using the other features. The chat included many games that could grant rewards such as a casino, reaction-time game, and memory game.

While the DAPChat code is privated and the chat is no longer available, the intelligent and handsome programmers were not stopped from making new and imaginitive projects.

### The DCG

Its a card game based on an unfinished storyline that features multiplayer battles where players can place cards and use abilities.
Now, I won't say we've discontinued it, but the code did become a bit over-complicated and unmanagable that adding new cards and features was near impossible so we put it aside while we worked on the next project:

### DIRO

An MMO FPS set in a futuristic environment with sci-fi elements.
We strive to create a game with realistic physics and smooth multiplayer connections. This project is very much a WIP, but we expect to be done at some point in life.

For each of these we created a planning document, yet the DCG one became almost obsolete as we had to adjust the scope of the project as we went. We may publish the DIRO one after it's successfully completed and the scope is managed.

Give suggestions.
